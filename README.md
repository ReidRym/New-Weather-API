## Hi There!

Welcome to my weather dashboard! This application allows you to search for a city and view the current and future weather conditions for that city.

The current weather conditions are displayed with the city name, the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.

The 5-day forecast displays the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.

The city you search for is added to the search history and can be accessed by clicking on it.

Thank you for using my weather dashboard!
